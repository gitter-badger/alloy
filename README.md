# alloy
A Polyglot (any language) HTML Imports-based Module System for Web Components that Builds Instantly.

## Alloy's Five Principles
* Simple
* Instant (really, really fast).
* Polyglot (any language)
* Optimized for Web Component projects
* Free and Open Source (MIT License)

## How does Alloy compare with other Build Systems?
- Gulp, Brunch, Grunt, and other build systems are too slow, difficult to setup, and genereally not optimizable for Web Component projects.
- Vulcanize (polymer) is too slow, requires the use of html import syntax (combining HTML with script), and doesn't work with other compiled languages (TypeScript, ES6, Coffeescript, etc).
